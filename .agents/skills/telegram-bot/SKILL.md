description: Set up and run a private Telegram bot that lets the human chat with this coding agent from their phone. Use when the human asks to set up the telegram bot, to talk to the agent from Telegram, or to manage who can access it. This is a checklist to execute, not a document to describe. Start at step 0 right away by checking for an existing configured token.

# Telegram bot setup

This is a checklist to run, not a document to explain. Do not describe this file, do not list features, do not ask permission to start. Begin at step 0. One step per message, short messages, wait for the answer.

## Step 0: is it already configured?

First, make sure the bridge code is present: if there is no `src` folder next to this SKILL.md (plugin installs carry only this file), get the code and work from there:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hec-ovi/telegram-bot-skill && cd telegram-bot-skill
```

Then check for an existing token before asking anything, in this order, without ever printing it:

1. The environment variable (containers and rigs pass it this way):

```bash
[ -n "$TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN" ] && curl -s "https://api.telegram.org/bot${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}/getMe"
```

2. A `.env` file next to this SKILL.md:

```bash
curl -s "https://api.telegram.org/bot$(grep '^TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=' .env | cut -d= -f2-)/getMe"
```

No curl on this machine? Run `npm run setup` with no arguments instead: it finds the token the same way (env first, then `.env`), validates it against Telegram using Node alone, and prints the bot's username.

If the check says `"ok":true` (or setup prints the bot name), everything is already set up. Tell the human which bot it is and go straight to step 4 (start it) and step 6 (confirm). Only continue to step 1 when no place has a usable token.

## Step 1: ask for the token

Ask: "Do you already have a Telegram bot token from @BotFather? If yes: safest is to NOT paste it in this chat. Copy .env.example to .env, put the token after TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=, save, and say done. (Pasting it here works too if you prefer.) If no, just say no and I will guide you, it takes a minute."

If they say done (secure route), skip to step 3. If they paste a token (it looks like `123456789:AAE...`), also skip to step 3.

## Step 2: help them create one

Send these five messages one at a time. Wait for the human's answer between each.

1. "Open Telegram and search for @BotFather. It has a blue verified check. Say ready when it is open."
2. "Send it this message: /newbot"
3. "It asks for a name. Reply with anything, for example: My Agent"
4. "It asks for a username. It must end in bot, for example: maria_agent_bot. If it says taken, try another one ending in bot."
5. "It now sent you a long token that looks like 123456789:AAE... That token is a SECRET, whoever has it controls your bot. Safest: copy .env.example to .env, put it after TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=, save, and say done. Or paste it here and I will store it for you."

## Step 3: check and store the token

The token is a secret: never repeat it back to the human, never commit it, it lives only in `.env` (gitignored).

If the human filled `.env` themselves (secure route), validate and complete the file:

```bash
npm run setup
```

If the human pasted the token in chat instead, store and validate in one go:

```bash
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=<token> npm run setup
```

Either way, setup checks the token against Telegram, writes `.env` with file mode 600, and records the bot's username. If it fails with 401, the token is wrong: go back to step 1.

## Step 4: start the bridge

From the folder that contains this SKILL.md:

```bash
npm run bg
```

It starts the bridge detached, waits until the claim link and QR appear, prints them, and RETURNS, so it never blocks your shell. `npm run status` checks on it, `npm run stop` stops it. It reads `.env` by itself, so the same command works after any reboot: no arguments, no reconfiguration, nothing to install (zero dependencies). Never start a second bridge while one is running: one token allows exactly one poller. (`npm start` is the same bridge in the foreground, for humans and process managers.)


## Step 5: hand over the claim link

The first start prints a one-time link like `https://t.me/<botname>?start=<code>` and a QR code of it. Tell the human: scan the QR with your phone or tap the link, then press Start in Telegram. The first tap becomes the owner and the code stops working.

## Step 6: confirm it works

Tell the human to send the bot any message from their phone. They should see the typing indicator, a status message that updates while the agent works, then the answer. Anyone else who messages the bot gets "this bot is private", and the owner gets Approve / Guest / Block buttons for them.

## Optional: rename the bot, set its description or avatar

If the human wants to change how the bot looks (any time, not just during setup):

- Display name, profile description, and the short "about" line can be set from here:

```bash
BOT_NAME="My Agent" BOT_DESCRIPTION="What this bot does" BOT_ABOUT="short profile line" npm run setup
```

- The @username can never be changed; that would mean creating a new bot.
- The avatar cannot be set through the Bot API. Guide the human: open @BotFather, send `/setuserpic`, pick the bot, then send it the photo.

## Optional: answer from this session instead (MCP)

`npm run bg` spawns a fresh headless agent per message. The alternative surface: this very session answers. Two routes: your harness spawns the server itself through the repo's `.mcp.json` (server `telegram`, stdio), or you start `npm run mcp:http` once and install it by URL with your own CLI's MCP-add command (slash form: `/mcp add telegram http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp`; command form: `claude mcp add --transport http telegram http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp`, swap the binary for the CLI you are running in). Stop any running bridge first (`npm run stop`; one token allows one poller), then serve: call `wait_for_message`, do what the returned message asks, answer with `send_message` to the same chat_id, repeat. `bridge_status` has the claim link while the bot is unclaimed; `list_users` / `set_user_tier` manage access. Push mode (messages inject themselves, no wait loop) exists for Claude Code v2.1.80+; see the README's MCP section.

## If something fails

- The `telegram` MCP server is missing or unreachable (nothing to `/mcp add`, `mcp_connect` refused): the MCP surface is SELF-HOSTED, nothing runs until the user starts it. Guide the human, exactly this: "First start the server: from the telegram-bot-skill repo root run `npm run mcp:http` and leave it running. Then install it in your CLI with its MCP-add command, e.g. `/mcp add telegram http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp` or `claude mcp add --transport http telegram http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp` (swap the binary for your CLI)." Clients that spawn stdio servers themselves (any CLI that reads this repo's `.mcp.json` on open) skip the first step: it starts the server for them. Remember one token allows one poller, so `npm run stop` any running bridge first.
- The bridge or MCP server logs `fetch failed` while `curl https://api.telegram.org` works: the host resolves an IPv6 route it cannot use, or sits far enough from Telegram that node's 250 ms family-autoselection gives up. Start it with `NODE_OPTIONS="--dns-result-order=ipv4first --no-network-family-autoselection"`.
- Telegram answers 401: bad or revoked token. Redo steps 1 to 3.
- "Is the bridge online?" Check where it runs: the process, or `docker compose ps bot` in the docker rig. From Telegram's side, `curl -s "https://api.telegram.org/bot${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}/getUpdates"` returning a 409 conflict proves a bridge is polling; a normal reply proves nothing (and the probe may briefly bump the real bridge, which recovers by itself). Never look for the process from inside a different container.
- The bot never replies: check the bridge process is still running and the machine has internet. No ports or public IP are needed.
- A non-owner gets "cannot enforce per-tier tool limits": expected until per-tier enforcement ships (phase 6); only the owner can run the agent for now.

Optional env vars for step 4: `STATE_FILE` (default `./bot-state.json`), `AGENT_CWD` (folder the agent works in), `AGENT_ADAPTER` (`claude-code` default, or `pi`), `PI_MODEL` (for pi, e.g. `local/llm`), `OWNER_ID` (recover mode: comma-separated Telegram ids seeded as owner at boot, skips the claim link entirely; more than one id means multiple co-owners, each with full, unrestricted access; also `TRUSTED_IDS` / `GUEST_IDS` / `BLOCKED_IDS`, comma-separated).
